# Changelog

## [4.0.6](https://github.com/eddyizm/tempo/releases/tag/v4.0.6) (2025-10-26)
## Attention
This release will not update previous installs as it is considered a new app, no longer `Tempo`, new icon, new app id, and new app name. Hoping it will not be a huge inconvenience but was necessary in order to publish to app stores like IzzyDroid and FDroid.  

**Android Auto** 
Support should be the same as before, however, I was not able to test any of the icons/visuals, so please let me know if there are any remnants of the tempo logo/icon as I believe I removed them all and replaced them successfully.
